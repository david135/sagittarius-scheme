#  Sagittarius Scheme System
#

* What is this?
  This is a Scheme implementation which trys to support R6RS specification.

* How to build and install?
  You need CMake(higher than 2.8.2) to build Sagittarus. You can get it from
  http://www.cmake.org/
  Currently I only check on Cygwin so there might be alot of problems to build
  other POSIX environemnt.
  Just type this on your console.

  % cmake .
  % make
  % make install

  I did not provide any test or check target yet.

* How to develop it?
  You need Gauche (R5RS Scheme implementation made by Shiro Kawai) and Ypsilon
  (R6RS Scheme implementation made by Yoshikatu Fujita), if you want to develop
  compiler.scm or base libraries which are provided by Scheme and stub files.
  There are some convenient scripts on the same level as this file. autogen.sh
  and geninsn.sh. These scripts creates compiler, vm instruction, base library,
  and c proceduers. For more detail, see the files.
