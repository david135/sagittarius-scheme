#  Sagittarius Scheme System
#

* What is this?
  This is a Scheme implementation which trys to support R6RS specification.

* How to build and install?
  You need CMake(higher than 2.8.2) to build Sagittarus. You can get it from
  http://www.cmake.org/

  Pre condition:
  We did not provide Boehm GC which are used in Sagittarus Scheme. So you need
  to install it first. On Cygwin or other POSIX environment it must be easy.  

  Cygwin or other POSIX environment
  Just type this on your console.

  % cmake .
  % make
  % make install

  I did not provide any test or check target yet.

  Windows
  You might need to install Windows SDK and Visual studio 10.0 Express version.
  (If you have it, you don't have to). 
  If you don't have Boehm GC, you need to install it. You can download it from
  here http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ .
  To compile and install it, I had a lot of problem. So this might be helpful
  for you.
  You can use NT_MAKEFILE, but first you need to execute vcvars32.bat which is
  located in the directory you installed VC Express. Then you need to use nmake.
  Unfortunately Boehm GC does not have install target in its Win32 Makefile. In
  my case, I just copy it to VC express include and lib directory.
  Note: NT_MAKEFILE has some bug. Make sure your cl.exe support debug:full. If
        not, you just need to delete it.
  Note: In gc_cpp.cc you might need to change include path.
  You might need to type this
  command line:
  > cd <gc directory>
  > <VC Express installed directory>\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
  > nmake /f NT_MAKEFILE nodebug=1 all
  > copy gc.lib <VC Express installed directory>\lib
  > copy include\* <VC Express include directory>>\include\gc
    * I used explorer. So I'm not sure if this works.
  > <your cmake>
  CMake creates VC project files so that you can build it yourself.

* How to develop it?
  You need Gauche (R5RS Scheme implementation made by Shiro Kawai) and Ypsilon
  (R6RS Scheme implementation made by Yoshikatu Fujita), if you want to develop
  compiler.scm or base libraries which are provided by Scheme and stub files.
  There are some convenient scripts on the same level as this file. autogen.sh
  and geninsn.sh. These scripts creates compiler, vm instruction, base library,
  and c proceduers. For more detail, see the files.
