# Provided developer tool

We provide `autogen.sh` for developer and it generates boot code, VM
instructions and generated code from stub file.  For more details, see

If Sagittarius itself is so unstable to generate boot code, you can also
use [Gauche](http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html) for it.
